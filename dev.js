Your Question:How can I remove a specific item from an array in JavaScript?
Your Answer:-

You can use the Array.prototype.filter() method to remove a specific item from an array in JavaScript. This method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

Example:

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Use filter() to remove the item with value of 3
let updatedNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number !== 3);

console.log(updatedNumbers); // [1, 2, 4, 5]

Your Question:How do I check if an element is hidden in jQuery?
Your Answer:-

You can check if an element is hidden in jQuery by using the jQuery .is() method. The .is() method checks if the element matches the selector and returns true or false.

For example, if you want to check if the element with the id of "myDiv" is hidden, you can use the following code:

if ($("#myDiv").is(":hidden")) {
  // Element is hidden
} else {
  // Element is not hidden
}

Your Question:What does "use strict" do in JavaScript, and what is the reasoning behind it?
Your Answer:-

"use strict" is a directive to the JavaScript engine to enable strict mode. Strict mode is a way to opt into a restricted variant of JavaScript that eliminates some of the silent errors that are possible in regular JavaScript. It also enables certain features that are not available in regular JavaScript, such as block-level scoping.

The main reason for using strict mode is to help prevent bugs and errors by making sure that the code is written in a more secure and consistent manner. By enforcing strict rules, the code will be less likely to be vulnerable to security risks and other bugs.

Example:

"use strict";

function myFunction() {
  'use strict';
  var x = 10;
  var y = 20;
  var z = x + y;
  console.log(z);
}

myFunction(); // Outputs 30
