Your Question:How can I remove a specific item from an array in JavaScript?
Your Answer:-

You can use the Array.prototype.filter() method to remove a specific item from an array in JavaScript. This method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

For example, let's say you have an array of numbers called myArray, and you want to remove the number 5 from the array. You could use the following code:

let myArray = [1, 5, 10, 15, 20]; 

let filteredArray = myArray.filter(item => item !== 5); 

console.log(filteredArray); // Output: [1, 10, 15, 20]

Your Question:How do I check if an element is hidden in jQuery?
Your Answer:-

You can check if an element is hidden in jQuery by using the jQuery .is() method. This method checks the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and returns true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments.

For example, you can use the .is() method to check if an element is hidden by passing in the :hidden selector:

// Check if an element is hidden
if ($('#myElement').is(':hidden')) {
  console.log('Element is hidden');
} else {
  console.log('Element is not hidden');
}

Your Question:What does "use strict" do in JavaScript, and what is the reasoning behind it?
Your Answer:-

"use strict" is a directive that is used to enable strict mode in JavaScript. Strict mode is a way to opt-in to a restricted variant of JavaScript that helps catch common coding mistakes and potentially unsafe actions. It helps to prevent errors and potential security issues by changing the way certain parts of JavaScript work.

For example, strict mode eliminates the use of global variables and requires that variables are declared before they are used. This helps to prevent accidental assignments to global variables and helps to ensure that variables are defined before they are used.

Example: 

// Without 'use strict';
x = 3.14; // This will not throw an error
console.log(x); // 3.14

// With 'use strict';
'use strict';
x = 3.14; // This will throw an error
console.log(x); // Error: x is not defined
