Your Question:How do I include a JavaScript file in another JavaScript file?
Your Answer:-

You can include a JavaScript file in another JavaScript file using the JavaScript "import" statement.

Example: 

// File1.js
export const myFunction = () => {
  console.log("This is myFunction from File1.js");
};

// File2.js
import { myFunction } from "./File1.js";

myFunction(); // Outputs: "This is myFunction from File1.js"

Your Question:What is the difference between "let" and "var"?
Your Answer:-

The main difference between "let" and "var" is that "let" is a block-scoped variable and "var" is a function-scoped variable. 

Let's look at an example: 

// using var
function myFunction() {
  if (true) {
    var x = 5;
  }
  console.log(x); // x is 5
}
myFunction();

// using let
function myFunction() {
  if (true) {
    let x = 5;
  }
  console.log(x); // x is not defined
}
myFunction();

In the example above, the variable "x" is declared inside the if statement. The difference is that when "var" is used, the variable is accessible outside the if statement. But when "let" is used, the variable is only accessible inside the if statement.

Your Question:Which equals operator (== vs ===) should be used in JavaScript comparisons?
Your Answer:-

The strict equality operator (===) should be used in JavaScript comparisons. This operator checks for both the value and the type of the two operands to be equal.

For example:

let a = 5;
let b = "5";

console.log(a == b); // returns true
console.log(a === b); // returns false
