Your Question:Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?
Your Answer:-

Processing a sorted array is faster than processing an unsorted array because it takes less time to find a specific element in a sorted array. This is because a sorted array can be searched using a binary search algorithm which is much faster than linear search algorithms used to search unsorted arrays.

For example, if you want to find the element "x" in an array, a binary search algorithm requires only log2n comparisons to find the element, whereas a linear search algorithm requires n comparisons to find the element.

Below is an example of a binary search algorithm written in Java:

public static int binarySearch(int[] array, int x) { 
    int left = 0; 
    int right = array.length - 1; 
  
    while (left <= right) { 
        int mid = (left + right) / 2; 
  
        if (array[mid] == x) 
            return mid; 
  
        if (array[mid] < x) 
            left = mid + 1; 
  
        else
            right = mid - 1; 
    } 
  
    return -1; 
}

Your Question:What is the "-->" operator in C++?
Your Answer:-

The "-->" operator in C++ is a range-based for loop operator. It is used to iterate through the elements of a container. 

For example, if we have a vector of integers and we want to print out the elements of the vector, we can use a range-based for loop and the "-->" operator as follows:

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    std::vector<int> vec{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    for (int x : vec) 
        std::cout << x << ' ';

    std::cout << '\n';
    return 0;
}

The output of this code will be: 1 2 3 4 5
