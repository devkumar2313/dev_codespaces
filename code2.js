Your Question:How do JavaScript closures work?
Your Answer:-

A JavaScript closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function�s variables�scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function�s variables, and it has access to the global variables.

A closure is created when an inner function is defined within an outer function, and the inner function has access to the outer function's variables.

Example:

function outerFunction(x) {
  var y = 10;
  
  function innerFunction(a) {
    return x + y + a;
  }
  
  return innerFunction;
}

var myInnerFunction = outerFunction(5);

console.log(myInnerFunction(15)); // prints 30

Your Question:var functionName = function() {} vs function functionName() {}
Your Answer:-

The difference between var functionName = function() {} and function functionName() {} is that the first example is a function expression and the second example is a function declaration.

Function expressions are created when the execution reaches that line of code, whereas function declarations are parsed before any code is executed.

Example of a function expression:

var sayHello = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

sayHello(); // Outputs "Hello!"

Example of a function declaration:

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

sayHello(); // Outputs "Hello!"
