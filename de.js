Your Question:How can I remove a specific item from an array in JavaScript?
Your Answer:-

You can remove a specific item from an array in JavaScript using the Array.prototype.splice() method. This method allows you to remove a specified number of elements starting at a given index.

For example, if you have an array with the values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and you want to remove the item with the value of 3, you can use the following code:

var myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
myArray.splice(2, 1); // removes the item at index 2
console.log(myArray); // [1, 2, 4, 5]

Your Question:How do I check if an element is hidden in jQuery?
Your Answer:-

You can check if an element is hidden in jQuery using the ":hidden" selector.

Example:

$(document).ready(function(){
    if ($("#myElement").is(":hidden")) {
        // Element is hidden
    }
    else {
        // Element is visible
    }
});

Your Question:What does "use strict" do in JavaScript, and what is the reasoning behind it?
Your Answer:-

"Use strict" is a JavaScript directive which enables strict mode. Strict mode is a way to introduce better error-checking into your code. It helps you write secure and more efficient code.

The main purpose of strict mode is to prevent errors and potential security issues by changing the way JavaScript behaves. It eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors. It also disables some of the less secure features of JavaScript.

For example, in strict mode, you cannot use undeclared variables. If you try to use an undeclared variable, JavaScript will throw an error.

Example:

// Without strict mode
x = 10; 
// Without strict mode, this will not throw an error

// With strict mode
"use strict";
x = 10;
// With strict mode, this will throw an error: Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined
