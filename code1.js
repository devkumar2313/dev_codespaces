Your Question:How can I remove a specific item from an array in JavaScript?
Your Answer:-

You can use the splice() method to remove a specific item from an array in JavaScript. The syntax for the splice() method is as follows:

array.splice(index, 1);

Where index is the position of the item you want to remove from the array.

For example, if you have an array of numbers and you want to remove the number 5 from the array, you can use the following code:

var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
arr.splice(4, 1);

// arr is now [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]

Your Question:How do I check if an element is hidden in jQuery?
Your Answer:-

You can check if an element is hidden in jQuery using the jQuery .is() method.

For example:

$(document).ready(function(){
  var element = $('#myElement');
  if(element.is(':hidden')) {
    // Element is hidden
  } else {
    // Element is visible
  }
});

Your Question:What does "use strict" do in JavaScript, and what is the reasoning behind it?
Your Answer:-

"use strict" is a directive that enables strict mode in JavaScript. Strict mode is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript that throws more exceptions and disables certain features in an effort to make your code more secure, readable, and accurate. 

Strict mode helps you to write secure and high-quality code by preventing you from using certain unsafe features of JavaScript. For example, it prevents you from using undeclared variables, which can lead to bugs and security vulnerabilities. It also prevents you from using certain keywords that are reserved for future versions of JavaScript.

For example, consider this code without strict mode:

x = 10;

console.log(x);

This code will run without any errors, even though the variable x has not been declared. With strict mode enabled, however, the same code will throw an error:

"use strict";

x = 10;

console.log(x);

// Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined

By using strict mode, you can avoid potential bugs and security vulnerabilities that could arise from using undeclared variables.
